# CS 484: Assignment 3

## Project Title: FootWiz
FootWiz is a comprehensive dashboard containing all the latest information and statistics from over 880+ football leagues worldwide, providing users with the ability to interact with data about match events, lineups, players, statistics, and so on.

## Motivation
As someone who loves the sport, I wanted to create a project that focuses on creating an interactive dashboard with all the information about the leagues and teams I would like as a user. My main aim is to provide information in a concise manner, but also allow the user to dive in and get more detailed information if they would like.

## Front-End Data Manipulation
In this project, the front-end charts and visualizations are implemented through the pre-existing widgets provided by the API that is used in the project. The widgets are used to visualize league tables and will be used to display additional information requested by the user in the future.

## Testing
Unit tests will be written to validate user inputs as well as check internal logic of the application. The current unit test checks the passwords to make sure strong passwords are enforced. Future tests will focus on evaluating each data layer. 

## Development Strategy
Working individually on this project, I decided to use an agile development strategy to help me set up the proposal webpage. 

## Development Tools
Visual Studio Code, Chrome DevTools, GitHub
